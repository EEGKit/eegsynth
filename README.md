# EEGsynth

This repository contains the software for the [EEGsynth](http://www.eegsynth.org), an  open-source project to convert real-time EEG into control signals for sounds, music and visual effects.

The [EEGsynth](http://www.eegsynth.org) was initiated in 2015, by the  art-science collective [1+1=3](http://www.oneplusoneisthree.org). It provides the basis for their workshop and performance activities. Since 2016, the [EEGsynth](http://www.eegsynth.org) is also used by [Brain Control Club](http://cri-paris.org/scientific-clubs/brain-control-club/) of the [Centre de Recherches Interdisciplinaires](http://cri-paris.org/) as the basis for their study of Brain-Computer-Interfaces.

An overview of the software concept can be found on   [website](http://www.ouunpo.com/eegsynth/?page_id=514), and on some [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/RobertOostenveld/eegsynth-pitch-for-brainhackparis) we presented at the [Brainhack Paris](http://brainhack.org/brainhackparis/). More technical details and installation instructions can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/tree/master/doc) directory of this  [github repository](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth).

The EEGsynth project is open-source, non-commercial and developed by us in our own time. We are grateful to have received financial support from [Innovativ Kultur](http://www.innovativkultur.se/), [The Swedish Arts Grant Council](http://www.kulturradet.se/en/in-english/), [Kulturbryggan](http://www.konstnarsnamnden.se/default.aspx?id=18477) and [Stockholm County Council](http://www.sll.se/om-landstinget/Information-in-English1/).

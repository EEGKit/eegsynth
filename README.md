# The EEGsynth

![](doc/figures/EEGsynth_logo.svg?sanitize=true)

The EEGsynth is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) codebase released under the [GNU general public license]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) that provides a real-time interface between (open-hardware) devices for electrophysiological recordings (e.g. EEG, EMG and ECG) and analogue and digital devices (e.g. MIDI, games and analogue synthesizers). This allows one to use electrical brain/body activity to flexibly control devices in real-time, for what are called (re)active and passive brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs), biofeedback and neurofeedback. The EEGsynth does *not* allow diagnostics, and neither does it provide a GUI for offline analysis. Rather, the EEGsynth is intended as a collaborative interdisciplinary [open-source](https://opensource.com/open-source-way) and [open-hardware](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-hardware) project that brings together programmers, musicians, artists, neuroscientists and developers in scientific and artistic exploration.

* Detailed documentation and tutorials can be found under [documentation](doc/README.md)
* The EEGsynth is intended to be run from the command line, using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) scripts, and is not friendly for those not familiar with such an approach.
* The codebase and technical documentation are maintained on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth). It is strongly advised to work within you own cloned repository and keep up to date with EEGsynth commits, as the EEGsynth is in constant development.
* For installation please follow our installation instructions for [Linux](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/blob/master/doc/installation-linux.md), [OSX](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/blob/master/doc/installation-osx.md) and [Windows](https://github.com/eegsynth/eegsynth/blob/master/doc/installation-windows.md). Please note that Windows and OSX are not actively supported. Linux is the main target, partly because we want the EEGsynth to be compatible with the [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org/), partly because some Python libraries do not support Windows, and partly because we rely on command-line interface anyway.
* The EEGsynth was initiated by the art-science collective [1+1=3](http://oneplusoneisthree.org/) who uses the EEGsynth for its performances and workshops.
* The EEGsynth is used in the [COGITO](http://www.cogitoinspace.org/) project to transform 32-channel EEG into sound for realtime transmission by a 25-meter radiotelescope.
* The EEGsynth project is non-commercial and developed by us in our own time. We are grateful to have received financial support from [Innovativ Kultur](http://www.innovativkultur.se/), [The Swedish Arts Grant Council](http://www.kulturradet.se/en/in-english/), [Kulturbryggan](http://www.konstnarsnamnden.se/default.aspx?id=18477), [Stockholm County Council](http://www.sll.se/om-landstinget/Information-in-English1/) and [Helge Ax:son Johnsons](http://haxsonj.se/www/).
* All non-code is published on our [news blog](http://www.eegsynth.org/?page_id=621), and you can follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/EEGsynth/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eegsynth), and check our past and upcoming events on [our calendar](http://www.eegsynth.org/?calendar=eegsynth-calendar).

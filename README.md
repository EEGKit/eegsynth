# EEGsynth

Converting real-time EEG into sounds, music and visual effects. This repository contains the software for http://www.eegsynth.org.

## What is it?

The EEGsynth is both a device, software and a collaborative interdisciplinary research project. As a device and software, it interfaces with the brain and body for artistic and scientific exploration, research and expression, allowing anyone to use their own brain and body activity to flexibly and powerfully control performative equipment in real-time. In short, it transforms electrophysiological signals (EEG, EMG and ECG) into analogue and digital control signals by means of sophisticated neuroscience signal analysis and custom-made hardware. As a project, it brings together musicians, artists, neuroscientists and developers to work together on technology for specific artistic performances.

## Brainhack@Paris

We made great progress at the BrainHack meeting in Paris. The pitch we presented there can be found on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/RobertOostenveld/eegsynth-pitch-for-brainhackparis).

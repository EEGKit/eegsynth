# Modulatetone module

The modulatetone module uses a number of control signals to modulate the amplitude of a number of pure sinewave tones. The sinewave tones are superimposed and played as audio. A receiving device (e.g., another computer running Max, a Bela, or a OWL Modular) can demodulate the different tones and use them as separate control signals.

This allows transmitting multiple controls over a mono or stereo analog audio line.

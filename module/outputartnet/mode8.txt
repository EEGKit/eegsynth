mode 8: dual color smooth slider, segment can be moved along the array (continuous over the edge)
  channel 1  = color 1 hue
  channel 2  = color 1 saturation
  channel 3  = color 1 value (intensity)
  channel 4  = color 2 hue
  channel 5  = color 2 saturation
  channel 6  = color 2 value (intensity)	[aa_alpha]
  channel 7  = overall intensity
  channel 8  = position				[aa_theta]
  channel 9  = width    (from 0-255 or 0-360 degrees, relative to the length of the array)
  channel 10 = ramp     (from 0-255 or 0-360 degrees, relative to the length of the array)

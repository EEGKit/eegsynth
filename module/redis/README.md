Redis module
============

The purpose of this module is to allow communication between (most) other modules, which use put/get and pub/sub to send and receive messages. Compared to the patching of an analog synthesizer with cables, the REDIS module allows all other modules to be flexibly linked to each other.

This module should be started prior to all other modules.

** Requirements **

None.

Redis module
============

The purpose of this module is to allow communication between (most) other modules, which use put/get and pub/sub to send and receive messages. Compared to an analog synthesizer, the redis module allows the flexible patching of all other modules. This module should be started prior to all other modules.


** Requirements **

None.

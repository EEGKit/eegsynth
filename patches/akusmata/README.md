# Akusmata

The performance at [Akusmata](http://akusmata.com/eegsynth-body-music-demonstration-by-oneplusoneisthree-guests/) was performed with both Per and Samon hooked up with their EEG. The EEGsynth was used with two patches, one running on a MacBook pro and another one running on a Dell Linux laptop. These were connected to the synthesizers of Jean-Louis and Stephen, respectively.

Additionally, Petri Kuljuntausta and Eleni Tsitsirikou performed as the soloists of the 1+1=3 group.

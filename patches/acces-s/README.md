Cogito
======

This is the patch for the Cogito presentation at acces-s cultures e©lectroniques in Pau (France) on 10 October 2019. The EEGsynth is configured to run on a Raspberry Pi with an HiFiBerry audio "hat". Furthermore, a Windows laptop is used for the EEG measurement and streaming the raw data to the Raspberry Pi.

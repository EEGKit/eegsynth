# Installation instructions for Windows

Since we don't have a Windows setup to develop and test it on, we cannot installation instructions. We recommend that you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) to install Python. Please look in the Linux and/or macOS installation instruction for the dependencies that you need to install.

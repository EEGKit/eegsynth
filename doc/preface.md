# Preface

The EEGsynth is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) codebase released under the 
[GNU general public license]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) 
that provides a real-time interface between (open-hardware) devices for electrophysiological recordings (e.g. EEG, EMG and ECG) 
and analogue and digital devices (e.g. MIDI, lights, games and analogue synthesizers).
The EEGsynth allows one to use electrical activity recorded from the brain or body to flexibly control devices in 
real-time, i.e. (re)active and passive brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs), biofeedback and neurofeedback. 
The EEGsynth does *not* allow diagnostics, and neither does it provide a GUI for offline analysis. 
Rather, the EEGsynth is intended as a collaborative interdisciplinary 
[open-source](https://opensource.com/open-source-way) 
and [open-hardware](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-hardware) project that brings together programmers, 
musicians, artists, neuroscientists and developers in scientific and artistic exploration.

Although there are plans to make it more 'plug-and-play', the EEGsynth has to be run from the command line, 
using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) scripts, 
and is therefor not friendly for those not familiar with such an approach.
